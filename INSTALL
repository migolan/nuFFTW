Installation instructions
-------------------------

If you're installing nuFFTW on a Mac, please read the note on the bottom of this page.

The nuFFTW installation process downloads and installs the external FFTW (in both double and single precision) and OSKI libraries. Note that this will take a while, mainly due to installation and benchmarking of OSKI.

In the future, when there will be updates to nuFFTW code, you won't have to rebuild FFTW and OSKI, but only to download the new files and "make" the nuFFTW. This is described in step 3 below.

Please let me know of any problems you encounter during installation or running, so I can track and debug them.



In order to install the nuFFTW library, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo.

2. Install fftw, oski and nuFFTW by running the install.sh script:
cd /path/to/nufftwinstallfolder
./install.sh
This will download and build the fftw and oski libraries, and build the nuFFTW binaries.
Note that installation will take a while, particularly the oski library installation.

3. If the installation was successful, then next time you update the nuFFTW source files from the above dropbox link there will be no need to build fftw and oski.
Just follow steps 1 and 2 to download the updated source files, and then make the nuFFTW:
cd /path/to/nufftwinstallfolder/src
make



Special note for mac users
-------------------------
If your default gcc is the one provided by Xcode (gcc version 4.2.1), you will have to install a more recent gcc version, because Xcode's gcc-4.2.1 doesn't enable openmp.
Macports has a gcc-4.7 (see here for example: http://www.ficksworkshop.com/blog/14-coding/65-installing-gcc-on-mac)
There's also a gcc-4.9 for Mac ready for installation at http://hpc.sourceforge.net .
