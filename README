nuFFTW is an auto-tuning, parallel library for computation of non-uniform fast Fourier transforms (nuFFTs).

For instructions on how to download and install the nuFFTW, please refer to this file: https://www.dropbox.com/s/zkdv323b5sf11rr/INSTALL

The current nuFFTW build has a command-line interface and a mex interface.
The following demos and overviews of these interfaces are available:
nuFFTW/matlab/html/nuFFTW_mex_overview.html
nuFFTW/matlab/html/nuFFT_mex_demo.html
nuFFTW/matlab/html/nuFFTW_mex_demo.html
nuFFTW/matlab/html/nuFFTW_cli_overview.html
nuFFTW/matlab/html/nuFFTW_cli_demo.html

You can also run the demos in MATLAB:
nuFFTW/matlab/nuFFT_mex_demo.m
nuFFTW/matlab/nuFFTW_mex_demo.m
nuFFTW/matlab/nuFFTW_cli_demo.m

Note that the mex interface can be used either in double precision or single but not both at the same time, otherwise MATLAB will likely crash.

Please let me know of any problems you encounter during installation or running,
so I can track and debug them.
